# 📊 Telecom Dataset – Statistical Analysis Project

This project involves a detailed statistical analysis of a telecom dataset using Python and Google Colab. The goal is to identify phones suitable for children based on multiple specifications like screen resolution, camera quality, memory, and battery power.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore and understand the dataset using basic statistics.
- Create new features like:
  - 📐 Screen Resolution (`Px`)
  - 📏 Screen Diagonal (`Scr_d`)
- Visualize feature distributions using histograms.
- Apply statistical measures like **mean**, **median**, and **quartiles**.
- Filter phones based on logical conditions related to desired features.
- Study the variability of numerical features using the **coefficient of variation**.

---

## 📁 Dataset Features Analyzed

- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Touchscreen, External Memory
- **Display**: Pixel Height & Width, Screen Height & Width
- **Camera**: Primary Camera (PC), Front Camera (FC)
- **Performance**: RAM, Internal Memory, Battery Power
- **Design**: Weight, Depth
- **Price**: Used for final sorting

## 🧠 Statistical Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, quartiles)
- Data filtering with logical conditions
- Feature engineering (new column creation)
- Histograms for data distribution
- Standard deviation to mean ratio (coefficient of variation)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Google Colab
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

---

## ✅ Final Output

A filtered DataFrame of phones that meet the children's preferences for:
- High screen resolution and size
- Good camera quality
- Strong memory and battery power
- Lightweight and slim design
- Support for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, touchscreen, and external memory

Sorted by the **lowest price** to help choose the best affordable options.
